ISO 27001 Addressing Information Security Within Supplier Agreements

ISO 27001 Annex A 5.20 Addressing information security within supplier agreements is an ISO 27001 control that requires an organisation to establish and agree information security requirements with suppliers.
It is about having a legal mechanism in place. A contract or an agreement or terms of business.
Suppliers represent one of your biggest risks as you cannot directly manage them or influence them and it is likely you rely on them, they have your data and provide services that you need to be successful.

Implementation Guide

We are going to rely on a couple of mechanism to ensure Information Security In Supplier Relationships.
Supplier Agreements / Contracts

The number one recommendation is to seek professional legal counsel for the provision of all contracts. The following is guidance but you should always defer to professional legal counsel. Always. You are not a lawyer. We are not a lawyer.
Our first line of defence and go to is the supplier agreement or supplier contract. At its core it is a legal mechanism that is legally binding and provides the greatest level of overall protection.
It sets out what is required, what will be done, who will do it, what happens if things go wrong.
What information is to be provided, accessed and the methods of access.
Legal, regulatory and contractual requirements. Elements such as intellectual property rights, copyright information, data protection requirements.
The controls and levels of controls that are required by both parties to the agreement.
Acceptable and unacceptable use of assets.
How to grant and remove access
Penalties, indemnities and remediation for failings to meet the contract.
Contact information
Screening requirements for staff were legally enforceable.
How evidence and assurance of information security will be provided
Rights to audit
How to solve problems or conflicts with the contract
Appropriate back up, business continuity and disaster recovery
The process for change management
Physical security as appropriate
Information transfer processes
Termination clauses and processes
Destruction and removal of data processes
Handover at the end of the contract
Contracts are kept and recorded in the ISO 27001 Supplier Register. They are reviewed at least annually, based on risk and significant change or event.
