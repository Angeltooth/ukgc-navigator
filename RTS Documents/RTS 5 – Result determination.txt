RTS requirement 5A
All reasonable steps should be taken to ensure that gambles are accepted, processed and settled in
accordance with the operators’ published terms and rules, and the rules of the specific game, event, or bet.
Where unexpected system flaws, faults, or errors that affect the customer occur, steps are to be taken as
soon as practicable to remedy the problem and ensure that the customer is treated fairly according to the
circumstances.
RTS implementation guidance 5A
a. Under normal operation, in the absence of technical faults, the system should act in accordance with
the rules.
b. Reasonable steps include testing of systems and new products against the published rules and
monitoring the ongoing performance of those products in the live environment. Refer to our testing
strategy for more detailed requirements in this area.
c. Customers should be notified when errors that affect them, for example, incorrectly settled bets, have
occurred as soon as practicable after the event occurs. Steps should be taken to rectify the error, for
example, by manually adjusting the customer’s account.
