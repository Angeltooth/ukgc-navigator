RTS 4 – Time-critical events
Applies to:
Gaming (including bingo), lotteries and betting on virtual events
RTS aim 4
To reduce the risk that customers are unfairly disadvantaged by technical factors that may affect speed of
response, and to ensure customers are made aware of the risk.
RTS requirement 4A
Where speed of interaction has a significant effect on the customer’s chance of winning, operators must
assess the level of risk and demonstrate to the Commission that they are taking reasonable steps to
reduce the risk to customers.
RTS implementation guidance 4A
Examples of possible approaches include:
a. estimating the degree of network latency (delay) a customer is experiencing and displaying regularly
updated information to the customer about any disadvantage that they may be operating under (for
example high, medium, low)
b. applying a handicapping system based on estimated performance and/or system latency
c. treating winning responses that arrive within a period of time as simultaneous and implementing a
policy on how simultaneous wins are to be dealt with.
RTS requirement 4B
For time-critical events, the customer should be informed that they might be at a disadvantage because of
technical issues such as slower network speeds, or slower end user device performance.
RTS implementation guidance 4B
a. Information should be included in game descriptions, rules, ‘help’ or ‘how to play’ pages.
