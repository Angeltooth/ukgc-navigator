For lotteries using external events - where it is not practical to demonstrate 7A the events outcomes should be: unpredictable, that is, events should be selected only where they may reasonably be assumed to be random events; unable to be influenced by the lottery operator (or external lottery manager); publicly available and externally verifiable, for example, events that are published in local or national press would be acceptable. For games or virtual events that use the laws of physics to generate the outcome of the game (mechanical RNGs), the mechanical RNG used should be capable of meeting the requirements in a. where applicable and in addition: the mechanical pieces should be constructed of materials to prevent decomposition of any component over time (for example, a ball shall not disintegrate); the properties of physical items used to choose the selection should not be altered; players should not have the ability to interact with, come into physical contact with, or manipulate the mechanics of the game. Restricting adaptive behaviour prohibits automatic or manual interventions that change the probabilities of game outcomes occurring during play.
