    "policies_required": {
      "question": "What policies do I need for ISO 27001 Annex A 5.17 Authentication Information?",

    },
    "importance": {
      "question": "Why is ISO 27001 Authentication Information important?",
      "answer": "Authentication information is the primary mechanism for proving identity and controlling access to systems and resources. Without proper authentication information management, access control fails and accountability is lost. It is fundamental to protecting all information assets"
    },
    "certification_requirement": {
      "question": "Do I have to satisfy ISO 27001 Annex A 5.17 for ISO 27001 Certification?",
      "answer": "Yes. While Annex A clauses are for consideration in Statement of Applicability, there is no valid reason to exclude authentication information. It is fundamental to any information security control framework and is explicitly required for ISO 27001 certification"
    },
    "write_policies_yourself": {
      "question": "Can I write policies for ISO 27001 Annex A 5.17 myself?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can write policies yourself. You will need a copy of the standard and approximately 5 days of focused time. It would be advantageous to have background in information security management systems. Multiple supporting documents are required in addition to the policy"
    },
    "templates_availability": {
      "question": "Where can I get templates for ISO 27001 Annex A 5.17?",
      "answer": "ISO 27001 templates supporting authentication information are available in ISO 27001 Toolkits"
    },
    "implementation_difficulty": {
      "question": "How hard is ISO 27001 Annex A 5.17?",
      "answer": "ISO 27001 Authentication Information is challenging due to extensive documentation requirements and system configuration needs. Templates are recommended to fast-track implementation"
    },
    "implementation_timeline": {
      "question": "How long will ISO 27001 Annex A 5.17 take me?",
      "answer": "From scratch with full implementation: 1 to 3 months. With proper templates, toolkit, and risk management approach: less than 1 day"
    },
    "implementation_cost": {
      "question": "What will ISO 27001 Annex A 5.17 cost me?",
      "answer": "If done yourself: free but 1-3 months of resource time (opportunity cost). With toolkit and templates: minimal cost but significant time savings and better quality"
